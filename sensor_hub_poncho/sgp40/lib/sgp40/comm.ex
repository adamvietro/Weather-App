  1. The sensor is powered up
  2. The I2C master periodically calls the measurement command and reads data in the following sequence:
    a. I2C master sends a measurement command.
    b. I2C master waits until the measurement is finished either by waiting for the maximum execution time or by waiting for the
    expected duration and then poll data until the read header is acknowledged by the sensor (expected durations are listed
    in Table 8).
  c. I2C master reads out the measurement result.
